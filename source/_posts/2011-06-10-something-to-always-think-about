title: Something to always think about
---
<p>My friend <a href="http://twitter.com/nicholasholland" target="_blank">Nicholas Holland (@nicholasholland)</a>, passed this gem on to me while I was working with him at <a href="http://www.centresource.com" target="_blank">CentreSource</a>. He heard it at a conference and shared it with me. I liked it and learned quite a bit from it so I wanted to share it as well!

</p><h2>story:</h2>
guy was traveling<br/>
had a terrible trip<br/>
went to 5 star hotel<br/>
got to his room at midnight<br/>
called roomservice, polite/professional guy answers<br/>
he asks for Milkshake<br/>
guys apologizes says they don&rsquo;t have it<br/>
then recommends a bowl of ice cream<br/>
the traveler says sure, and asks for a large glass of milk<br/>
the guy says, no problem<br/>
then the traveler asks for an extra glass and a tall spoon, the guy says sure<br/>
20 min later<br/>
tray arrives with bowl of ice cream, glass of milk, empty glass, and tall spoon<br/><br/><h2>moral:</h2>
the guy had everything he needed, including the desire to make the traveler happy, to make the milkshake
but he couldn&rsquo;t get past his own systems / limitations to actually make it&hellip; because the system didn&rsquo;t have a &lsquo;milkshake&rsquo; button, he couldn&rsquo;t get it done<br/>
thus, the traveler was less than happy - even though the guy had everything he needed to make the guy happy

title: SunshinePHP Miami
---
<p>This past weekend I attended <a href="http://sunshinephp.com/" target="_blank">SunshinePHP</a> in beautiful Miami, Florida. I was lucky enough to get to speak about our experiences building <a href="https://www.opensky.com" target="_blank">OpenSky</a> with <a href="http://www.symfony.com" target="_blank">Symfony</a>. The weather was perfect and I got to learn some new things as well. Below you can find the slides from my presentation.</p>

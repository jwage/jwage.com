        </header>

        <p class="lead">Posted on 2018-03-25 by jwage</p>

        <hr />

        <div>
            <p>When OSX Mavericks was released, I was excited to see that push notifications were supported within Safari. So now, just like iOS, we can send push notifications to Safari regardless of whether the browser is open or not. This post gives overview of how to get them working from PHP using the <a href="http://github.com/jwage/php-apns" target="_blank">PHP APNS</a> library.</p>

<h3>Registering with Apple and Generating Certificates</h3>

<p>This post assumes you have read <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/NotificationProgrammingGuideForWebsites/PushNotifications/PushNotifications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40013225-CH3-SW1" target="_blank">this</a> article from Apple and have already generated your security certificates.</p>

<h3>PHP APNS Library</h3>

<p>The PHP APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) library makes it extremely easy to get Safari push notifications working on your website. Just install it with composer to get started:</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<pre><code>composer require jwage/php-apns
composer install
</code></pre>

<h3>Push Package</h3>

<p>Once you have the package installed you can start integrating it with your website. The first thing we need to do is create a base push package for your website. From Apple&rsquo;s website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a user is asked for permission to receive push notifications, Safari asks your web server for a package. The package contains data that is used by the notification UI, such as your website name and icon, as well as a cryptographic signature. The signature verifies that your notification hasn’t been intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack and that it is indeed coming from a trusted source: you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can find a sample base push package within the PHP APNS library <a href="https://github.com/jwage/php-apns/tree/master/data/safariPushPackage.base" target="_blank">here</a>. Copy this somewhere in your application and customize the icons in the icon.iconset folder and the website.json:</p>

<pre><code>{
    "websiteName": "WebsiteName",
    "websitePushID": "web.com.domain",
    "allowedDomains": ["http://", "https://"],
    "urlFormatString": "http:///%@",
    "authenticationToken": "",
    "webServiceURL": "https:///safari_push_notifications/"
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Web Service Endpoints</h3>

<p>Now it is time to setup some endpoints in your web application for Safari to communicate with. You need endpoints to do the following:</p>

<ul><li>Generate a push package for an individual user.</li>
<li>Register a users device token.</li>
<li>Deregister a users device token.</li>
<li>Record log data sent by Safari when errors occur.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a pseudo controller demonstrating what each endpoint needs to do:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Controller;

use JWage\APNS\Certificate;
use JWage\APNS\Safari\PackageGenerator;

class SafariPushNotificationsController
{
    public function packageAction($userId)
    {
        // Send push notification package to browser when Safari asks user for permission to send you notifications.

        $certificate = new Certificate(file_get_contents('apns.p12'), 'certpassword');
        $packageGenerator = new PackageGenerator(
            $certificate, '/path/to/base/pushPackage/path', 'yourhost.com'
        );

        // returns JWage\APNS\Safari\Package instance
        $package = $packageGenerator-&gt;createPushPackageForUser('userid');

        // send $package-&gt;getZipPath() to the browser
    }

    public function registerAction($userId, $deviceToken)
    {
        // store $deviceToken on the $userId so you can use it later to send pushes
    }

    public function deregisterAction($userId, $deviceToken)
    {
        // remove $deviceToken from $userId
    }

    public function logAction($userId)
    {
        // log information sent for debugging purposes
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Requesting Permission</h3>

<p>Requesting permission to send a user notifications in Safari can be done using this little snippet of javascript on your website:</p>

<pre><code>if ('safari' in window &amp;&amp; 'pushNotification' in window.safari) {
    var checkRemotePermission = function (permissionData) {
        if (permissionData.permission === 'default') {
            window.safari.pushNotification.requestPermission(
                'http://domain.com/safari_push_notifications/',
                'web.com.domain',
                {
                    'userId': 
                },
                checkRemotePermission
            );
        } else if (permissionData.permission === 'denied') {
            // do something when permission is denied
        } else if (permissionData.permission === 'granted') {
            // do something when permission is granted
        }
    };

    // Ensure that the user can receive Safari Push Notifications.
    var permissionData = window.safari.pushNotification.permission('web.com.domain');
    checkRemotePermission(permissionData);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a user visits your website with Safari in OSX Mavericks it will hit your web services endpoint, download the push package and ask the user if they want to receive notifications from your website.</p>

<h3>Sending Push Notifications</h3>

<p>Once you have done all of the above, you should be ready to send push notifications. The PHP APNS library makes this extremely easy. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>use JWage\APNS\Certificate;
use JWage\APNS\Client;
use JWage\APNS\Sender;
use JWage\APNS\SocketClient;

$certificate = new Certificate(file_get_contents('apns.pem'));
$socketClient = new SocketClient($certificate, 'gateway.push.apple.com', 2195);
$client = new Client($socketClient);
$sender = new Sender($client);

$sender-&gt;send('devicetoken', 'Title of push', 'Body of push', 'http://deeplink.com');
</code></pre>

<p>You can create an easy to use service in your application for sending push notifications to an instance of <code>User</code>, assuming it implements a <code>getSafariDeviceToken()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>class SafariPushNotificationSender
{
    private $sender;

    public function __construct(Sender $sender)
    {
        $this-&gt;sender = $sender;
    }

    public function sendToUser(User $user, $title, $body, $link)
    {
        return $this-&gt;sender-&gt;send($user-&gt;getSafariDeviceToken(), $title, $body, $link);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now it is as simple as the following:</p>

<pre><code>$safariPushNotificationSender = new SafariPushNotificationSender($sender);
$safariPushNotificationSender-&gt;sendToUser($user, 'Title of push', 'Body of push', 'http://deeplink.com');
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this was helpful! If you have any questions please leave them in the comments. Enjoy!</p>

        </header>

        <p class="lead">Posted on 2018-03-25 by jwage</p>

        <hr />

        <div>
            <p>Here are a few tricks I&rsquo;ve learned working with MongoDB and PHP.</p>

<p><strong>Create DateTime from MongoId</strong></p>

<p>Because MongoDB identifiers contain the date you can easily create a <code>DateTime</code> instance from them.</p>

<pre><code>public function getDateTimeFromMongoId(MongoId $mongoId)
{
    $dateTime = new DateTime('@'.$mongoId-&gt;getTimestamp());
    $dateTime-&gt;setTimezone(new DateTimeZone(date_default_timezone_get()));
    return $dateTime;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is useful when you don&rsquo;t want to create an additional field to store the date a document was created. You can also use the _id index that already exists to paginate and filter/sort by date.</p>

<p><strong>Create MongoId with Date in the Past</strong></p>

<p>For the same reason as above, you can create a MongoId instance with a date in the past. This was copied from a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14370143/create-mongodb-objectid-from-date-in-the-past-using-php-driver/14380093#14380093" target="_blank">stackoverflow answer</a> by <a href="http://derickrethans.nl/" target="_blank">Derek Rethans</a>.</p>

<pre><code>public createMongoIdFromTimestamp($timestamp)
{
    $ts = pack('N', $timestamp);
    $m = substr(md5(gethostname()), 0, 3);
    $pid = pack('n', posix_getpid());
    $trail = substr(pack('N', $this-&gt;inc++), 1, 3);

    $bin = sprintf('%s%s%s%s', $ts, $m, $pid, $trail);

    $id = '';
    for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 12; $i++ ) {
        $id .= sprintf('%02X', ord($bin[$i]));
    }

    return new \MongoID($id);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This was useful when migrating legacy data in to a collection where we utilize the _id for pagination and displaying a created date. If we simply created identifiers with todays date then it would show old records with all the same date and pagination/sorting would be broken.</p>

        </header>

        <p class="lead">Posted on 2018-03-25 by jwage</p>

        <hr />

        <div>
            <p><strong>I recently finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Road-Serfdom-Intellectuals-Socialism/dp/0255365764" target="_blank">The Road to Serfdom</a> by Friedrich Hayek. Here are some parts that stood out to me.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are ready to accept almost any explanation of the present crisis of our civilization except one: that the present state of the world may be the result of genuine error on our own part and that the pursuit of some of our most cherished ideals has apparently produced results utterly different from those which we expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>“Democracy extends the sphere of individual freedom,” he said in 1848; “socialism restricts it. Democracy attaches all possible value to each man; socialism makes each man a mere agent, a mere number. Democracy and socialism have nothing in common but one word: equality. But notice the difference: while democracy seeks equality in liberty, socialism seeks equality in restraint and servitude.”</p>

<p>&ldquo;While it is true, of course, that inventions have given us tremendous power, it is absurd to suggest that we must use this power to destroy our most precious inheritance: liberty. It does mean, however, that if we want to preserve it, we must guard it more jealously than ever and that we must be prepared to make sacrifices for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The “social goal,” or “common purpose,” for which society is to be organized is usually vaguely described as the “common good,” the “general welfare,” or the “general interest.” It does not need much reflection to see that these terms have no sufficiently definite meaning to determine a particular course of action. The welfare and the happiness of millions cannot be measured on a single scale of less and more. The welfare of a people, like the happiness of a man, depends on a great many things that can be provided in an infinite variety of combinations. It cannot be adequately expressed as a single end, but only as a hierarchy of ends, a comprehensive scale of values in which every need of every person is given its place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although each individual might wish the state to act in some way, there will be almost as many views about what the government should do as there are different people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not difficult to see what must be the consequences when democracy embarks upon a course of planning which in its execution requires more agreement than in fact exists. The people may have agreed on adopting a system of directed economy because they have been convinced that it will produce great prosperity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the democratic legislature will long hesitate to relinquish the decisions on really vital issues, and so long as it does so it makes it impossible for anyone else to provide the comprehensive plan. Yet agreement that planning is necessary, together with the inability of democratic assemblies to produce a plan, will evoke stronger and stronger demands that the government or some single individual should be given powers to act on their own responsibility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The belief is becoming more and more widespread that, if things are to get done, the responsible authorities must be freed from the fetters of democratic procedure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hitler did not have to destroy democracy; he merely took advantage of the decay of democracy and at the critical moment obtained the support of many to whom, though they detested Hitler, he yet seemed the only man strong enough to get things done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing distinguishes more clearly conditions in a free country from those in a country under arbitrary government than the observance in the former of the great principles known as the Rule of Law. Stripped of all technicalities, this means that government in all its actions is bound by rules fixed and announced beforehand—rules which make it possible to foresee with fair certainty how the authority will use its coercive powers in given circumstances and to plan one’s individual affairs on the basis of this knowledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hence the familiar fact that the more the state “plans,” the more difficult planning becomes for the individual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those most immediately interested in a particular issue are not necessarily the best judges of the interests of society as a whole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The important thing is that the rule enables us to predict other people’s behavior correctly, and this requires that it should apply to all cases—even if in a particular instance we feel it to be unjust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man is free if he needs to obey no person but solely the laws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The idea that there is no limit to the powers of the legislator is in part a result of popular sovereignty and democratic government. It has been strengthened by the belief that, so long as all actions of the state are duly authorized by legislation, the Rule of Law will be preserved. But this is completely to misconceive the meaning of the Rule of Law. This rule has little to do with the question whether all actions of government are legal in the juridical sense. They may well be and yet not conform to the Rule of Law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the law says that such a board or authority may do what it pleases, anything that board or authority does is legal—but its actions are certainly not subject to the Rule of Law. By giving the government unlimited powers, the most arbitrary rule can be made legal; and in this way a democracy may set up the most complete despotism imaginable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, when security is understood in too absolute a sense, the general striving for it, far from increasing the chances of freedom, becomes the gravest threat to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no reason why in a society which has reached the general level of wealth which ours has attained the first kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must here return for a moment to the position which precedes the suppression of democratic institutions and the creation of a totalitarian regime. In this stage it is the general demand for quick and determined government action that is the dominating element in the situation, dissatisfaction with the slow and cumbersome course of democratic procedure which makes action for action’s sake the goal. It is then the man or the party who seems strong and resolute enough “to get things done” who exercises the greatest appeal. “Strong” in this sense means not merely a numerical majority—it is the ineffectiveness of parliamentary majorities with which people are dissatisfied. What they will seek is somebody with such solid support as to inspire confidence that he can carry out whatever he wants. It is here that the new type of party, organized on military lines, comes in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That socialism can be put into practice only by methods which most socialists disapprove is, of course, a lesson learned by many social reformers in the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to be almost a law of human nature that it is easier for people to agree on a negative program—on the hatred of an enemy, on the envy of those better off— than on any positive task.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The definitely antagonistic attitude which most planners take toward internationalism is further explained by the fact that in the existing world all outside contacts of a group are obstacles to their effectively planning the sphere in which they can attempt it. It is therefore no accident that, as the editor of one of the most comprehensive collective studies on planning has discovered to his chagrin, “most ‘planners’ are militant nationalists.”</p>

<p>&quot;The desire to organize social life according to a unitary plan itself springs largely from a desire for power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have seen before how the separation of economic and political aims is an essential guaranty of individual freedom and how it is consequently attacked by all collectivists. To this we must now add that the “substitution of political for economic power” now so often demanded means necessarily the substitution of power from which there is no escape for a power which is always limited. What is called economic power, while it can be an instrument of coercion, is, in the hands of private individuals, never exclusive or complete power, never power over the whole life of a person. But centralized as an instrument of political power it creates a degree of dependence scarcely distinguishable from slavery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would, however, be highly unjust to regard the masses of the totalitarian people as devoid of moral fervor because they give unstinted support to a system which to us seems a denial of most moral values. For the great majority of them the opposite is probably true: the intensity of the moral emotions behind a movement like that of National Socialism or communism can probably be compared only to those of the great religious movements of history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet while there is little that is likely to induce men who are good by our standards to aspire to leading positions in the totalitarian machine, and much to deter them, there will be special opportunities for the ruthless and unscrupulous. There will be jobs to be done about the badness of which taken by themselves nobody has any doubt, but which have to be done in the service of some higher end, and which have to be executed with the same expertness and efficiency as any others. And as there will be need for actions which are bad in themselves, and which all those still influenced by traditional morals will be reluctant to perform, the readiness to do bad things becomes a path to promotion and power. The positions in a totalitarian society in which it is necessary to practice cruelty and intimidation, deliberate deception and spying, are numerous. Neither the Gestapo nor the administration of a concentration camp, neither the Ministry of Propaganda nor the SA or SS (or their Italian or Russian counterparts), are suitable places for the exercise of humanitarian feelings.13 Yet it is through positions like these that the road to the highest positions in the totalitarian state leads. It is only too true when a distinguished American economist concludes from a similar brief enumeration of the duties of the authorities of a collectivist state that “they would have to do these things whether they wanted to or not: and the probability of the people in power being individuals who would dislike the possession and exercise of power is on a level with the probability that an extremely tender-hearted person would get the job of whipping-master in a slave plantation.”</p>
